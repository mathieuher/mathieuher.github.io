## Few words about me
Hey I'm Mat 🙂<br>
Love the process of create and learn new skills 👨‍🔧<br>

Spend some of my spare time on building small vehicles, watches or mechanisms 🚙<br>
The optimal way of doing it is not a goal. I prefer explore, discover, create and sometimes torture simple mechanism.<br>

## Project running
### RetroSki
Started as a small dev project to create a small ski game to play with friends @ home.<br>
This project is a nice way to discover the game engine <a href="https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur">excaliburjs</a> ⚔️<br>
We already spent good times on the game grinding the local records 🎮<br>
